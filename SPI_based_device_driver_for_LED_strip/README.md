# SPI_based_device_driver_for_LED_strip
Developed a SPI device driver to be installed on Intel Galileo Gen2 board which accepts n pixel information from users and light up 16 RGB LEDs of a LED ring using a call that initiates an asynchronous SPI transfer that leads to a proper 1-wire data transmission on SPI-MOSI for timed display. A user-level testing program has been implemented which uses the WS2812 driver to show a circular display pattern continuously. Furthermore, implemented a bit-banging approach to drive WS2812-based LED strip using two delay mechanisms, ndelay() and hrtimer.
