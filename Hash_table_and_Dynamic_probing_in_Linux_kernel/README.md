# Hash_table_and_Dynamic_probing_in_Linux_kernel
Developed a character device driver with two device files which can be accessed as hash tables in the kernel space and implemented a multi-threaded test program to perform file operations and access the table through APIs.

Implemented a kernel module that uses kprobe API to allow the user to add and remove dynamic probes in any kernel functions through command line interface.
Offsets of symbol and variables of interest were  calculated by observing the ELF file and object dump output. 
Collected pre-handler and post-handler trace data as well as local and global variable values generated by multiple kprobe hits in a shared ring buffer.
